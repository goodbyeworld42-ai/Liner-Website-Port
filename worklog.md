Task: Build a full browser-based music app (web version) inspired by the user's referenced repo tryliner/desktop (Liner — Electron music player)

Work Log:
- Loaded fullstack-dev skill, initialized Next.js 16 environment
- Cloned and analyzed the reference repo (Electron + React 19 music player: home feeds, library/playlists, search, synced lyrics, fullscreen player, queue)
- Tested public music APIs from sandbox: Audius (trending/search/stream OK, full-length, no key), iTunes Search (OK, 30s previews), Deezer (blocked)
- Designed original app "Lyra": dark-first theme with red accent (#ff4d4d), Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui
- Prisma schema: Playlist, PlaylistTrack, LikedTrack, PlayHistory (SQLite, db pushed)
- Backend routes: /api/music/{trending,underground,search,track/[id],artist/[id],playlist/[id],playlists-trending}, /api/music/stream/[id] (Range-passthrough proxy, source-namespaced audius/itunes), /api/playlists CRUD + tracks add/remove, /api/likes toggle, /api/history record/clear
- Client: Zustand stores (player engine with shuffle/repeat/queue/volume, library, UI navigation), AudioEngine single <audio> element + Media Session API
- UI: sidebar + mobile bottom nav, topbar (search focus "/", theme toggle), player bar (seek, volume, like, queue count), fullscreen player with per-track aurora visuals, queue drawer, track rows/cards, skeletons, toasts, keyboard shortcuts (space/←→/N/P/F/Q/L/M/S/R/?), shortcuts dialog
- Views: Home (featured hero, jump back in, trending, underground, playlists for you, genre rows), Search (debounced, artists/tracks/mainstream previews), Library (create/rename/delete playlists, history), Liked Songs, Playlist detail, Artist page, Audius collection view with "save to my library"
- Fixed during verification: stale Turbopack CSS cache (dev server restart via .zscripts/dev.sh), audio element remount bug (single stable <audio>), set-state-in-effect lint errors (theme via useSyncExternalStore, async-only setState), ui-store duplicate `view` declaration, mobile player bar overlapping bottom nav (bottom-[calc(52px+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))])
- Browser-verified end-to-end with agent-browser: playback via stream proxy, next/prev, like persistence, spacebar pause, queue drawer EQ, fullscreen aurora, search sections, artist page, playlist create + add track via context menu, mobile responsive layout, light/dark toggle

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable: full music streaming web app at / (single-page, Lyra branding, original code)
- Music sources: Audius public API (full tracks) + iTunes mainstream (30s previews, PREVIEW badge)
- Persistence: SQLite via Prisma (playlists, likes, history); volume/theme in localStorage
- All lint checks pass; agent-browser verified core flows on desktop (1280x800) and mobile (390x844)

Task: Port the real Liner desktop music app (tryliner/desktop) to a browser web version — no fork, genuine Liner sources served as a website.

Work Log:
- Cloned https://github.com/tryliner/desktop.git to /home/z/my-project/liner-ref (Electron+React 19+Vite+Tailwind v4 renderer, Zustand stores, Innertube/SoundCloud/Liner-API sources)
- Architecture finding: the renderer is web-native; Electron only adds a CORS-bypassing proxy (electron/cors.ts), a WASM request signer (optional, API tolerates unsigned), and native integrations (window controls, touchbar, discord, overlay)
- Verified api.tryliner.fun natively allows CORS from any origin; music.youtube.com, api-v2.soundcloud.com, googlevideo, sndcdn do NOT -> need same-origin proxy
- Created working copy /home/z/my-project/liner-app with surgical patches only:
  - vite.config.ts: removed vite-plugin-electron, base "/liner/"
  - src/shared/lib/webProxy.ts (NEW): cross-origin URL rewrite map + global fetch interceptor (innertube -> /api/yt, sc api -> /api/sc, media -> /api/media, generic -> /api/fetch)
  - main.tsx: installs interceptor before any app module
  - playerRuntime.ts: audio.src routed through rewriteForWeb (crossOrigin=anonymous element needs same-origin media)
- Next.js 16 shell (port 3000): rewrites "/" -> /liner/index.html (HashRouter SPA), 4 proxy routes (api/yt, api/sc, api/media, api/fetch) with header forwarding, x-liner-user-agent -> User-Agent mapping, Range support
- Key bugs found & fixed: Set.prototype.some misuse in webProxy (broke all proxied fetches), api.tryliner.fun wrongly matching media-proxy rule (login 405), relative vite base breaking assets under rewrite, Next.js dev truncating streamed pass-through bodies (switched to buffered passthrough, bounded by size caps)
- Built SPA with Vite (rolldown) and deployed to public/liner; cover-sw.js served at root with Service-Worker-Allowed: /

Stage Summary:
- VERIFIED END-TO-END via agent-browser: genuine Liner login/register UI renders; auth preflight+POST reach the real Liner API (401 on bad creds); VisitorSession fetches valid visitorData via proxy; Innertube search/next/player return real catalog data (ANDROID_VR profile returns direct audio URLs, playabilityStatus OK); googlevideo audio streams through /api/media with Range (206, audio/mp4); SoundCloud clientId discovery + API proxy verified (transparent relay)
- Registration is network-rate-limited by Liner backend (NETWORK_ACCOUNT_LIMIT) — user signs in with their existing Liner account; authenticated flows use the same verified API path
- Artifacts: liner-app/ (patched sources), public/liner/ (built SPA), src/app/api/{yt,sc,media,fetch}/ (proxies), src/lib/liner-proxy.ts
